# MDAndersonSummerProject
I interened at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2017 as part of their Summer Program in Cancer Research, 
and my project was to design and implement an information visualization software for genome-scale cancer data using R.

Unfortunately, I can't show the project in its entirety on github.  
This is all that I can share for the project.  Thank you for understanding.
